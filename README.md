# blocky-beats
Blocky Beats is a small, lo-fi rhythm game that I made after making another rhythm game, Nightmare on Beat Street, for the Scream Jam 2023. I wanted to make a pure rhythm game instead of something horror/action themed so I ended up with Blocky Beats. Blocky Beats is meant to be low-key with calming, gentle beats. It's not meant to be particularly difficult, but rather something you might play on a rainy day or if you just want to relax and listen to some music. There's only 5 levels right now, but I might add more in a future update.

- Match rhythm arrows as music plays.
- Unlock next level by scoring an 80% or more on current level.
- Improve score by trying to match arrows more precisely and by not missing any arrows.
- Use arrow keys, WASD keys, or buttons to match rhythm arrows. When the scrolling arrow is OVER the arrow outline, press the correct key (left, right, up, down) to match the arrow.
